  mitigations:
    - Patch all CVEs listed in AA25-239A
    - Disable unused management services
    - Enforce SNMPv3 with strong authentication
    - Monitor and alert on SPAN/ERSPAN changes
    - Implement strict ACL change management
    - Disable Guest Shell unless required
    - Use non-standard ports only with strong justification
    - Enable comprehensive logging
    - Implement network segmentation
